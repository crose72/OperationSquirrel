        <h1>About Operation Squirrel</h1>
        <p>Open-source robotics built for schools, students, and aspiring engineers.</p>

        <h2>The Founders</h2>
        <p>
            The Operation Squirrel development kit was created by <strong>Shaun Bowman</strong> and <strong>Cameron Rose</strong>, 
            two software engineers who met while working together on General Motors’ Super Cruise (Level&nbsp;2 autonomous) driving program. 
            The drone autonomy stack that evolved into Operation Squirrel began as a side project—an effort to build an advanced, 
            high-performance autonomous drone using affordable, off-the-shelf components without compromising engineering quality.
        </p>              

        <h3>Shaun — Senior AI/ML Software Engineer (Torc Robotics)</h3>
        <p>
            Shaun is currently a Senior AI/ML Software Engineer at Torc Robotics, where he develops core 
            communication and software infrastructure for commercial self-driving semi-trucks.  His work
            includes accelerating AI inference systems using NVIDIA CUDA, TensorRT, and other GPU acceleration
            software on a cluster of Jetson AGX Orin embedded computers.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Before joining Torc, Shaun worked as a Senior AI Engineer at General Motors, contributing to 
            several core components of the Super Cruise Level&nbsp;2 autonomous driving system. His work 
            included developing mapping systems and lateral control planning (such as automatic lane changes), 
            with software deployed across hundreds of thousands of production vehicles. Earlier in his career, 
            he supported hybrid vehicle calibration and testing within GM’s advanced propulsion programs. 
            These roles gave him extensive experience building real-time autonomous systems that meet rigorous 
            automotive safety and reliability standards. He is also an inventor on multiple patents related to 
            autonomous vehicle algorithms and system design.
        </p>               
        
        <p>
            Outside of industry projects, Shaun has built real autonomous platforms—including a Jetson-powered 
            self-driving RC car capable of operating autonomously at 60 mph. This hands-on work 
            demonstrates his practical experience in high-performance embedded autonomy.
        </p>
        

        <h3>Cameron — Embedded Systems & Vehicle Software Engineer</h3>
        <p>
            Cameron is an Embedded Software Engineer developing propulsion control and hybrid 
            mode-selection algorithms for modern automotive platforms. His work focuses on predictive 
            control—software that estimates future vehicle states and selects optimal operating 
            conditions in real time—and on building safety-critical, production-grade systems where 
            reliability and deterministic timing are essential. Prior to his propulsion work, Cameron 
            developed charge-time estimation algorithms for EVs including the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac 
            Lyriq, Escalade IQ, and Celestiq, and is an inventor on several related patents.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            He holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering and is currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer 
            Science (Machine Learning) to deepen his background in autonomy, perception, and GPU-accelerated 
            robotics. Cameron’s engineering experience spans firmware development, control algorithms, 
            system integration, and hardware–software interfacing across complex vehicle architectures.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Outside of industry, Cameron co-developed the Operation Squirrel autonomy stack, integrating 
            real-time perception, control, and embedded systems into a fully functioning autonomous drone 
            platform. His work bridges low-level engineering with applied machine learning and robotics.

        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
            Operation Squirrel started as an attempt to build a drone capable of 
            <strong>dynamic payload delivery</strong>—essentially playing catch with a moving target by 
            predicting where that target will be in the future and releasing the payload at precisely 
            the right moment. We wanted to achieve this using affordable, off-the-shelf hardware 
            while still pushing the limits of performance and autonomy.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            As we developed the system, we kept noticing the same gap: students rarely get access to 
            <strong>real engineering systems</strong>. Most educational robotics kits hide the important 
            parts—control loops, perception pipelines, timing constraints, data logging, noise, and 
            real-world failure modes—behind closed or oversimplified tools.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Operation Squirrel was built to change that. Our goal is to create a platform that is open, 
            practical, and technically real—a system that uses the exact same tools, workflows, and engineering 
            constraints found in professional autonomy, but remains accessible to students and educators.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Dynamic payload delivery is only the beginning. Solving it provides the foundation for 
            advanced autonomy behaviors—prediction, trajectory planning, and real-time decision-making 
            under uncertainty. It’s a gateway to the same problems tackled in industry-grade robotics systems.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This project has already led to high-value job opportunities for the engineers who worked on it. 
            Our goal is to give you and your students that same head start—hands-on experience with real 
            engineering and real autonomy— not toy examples or oversimplified kits.
