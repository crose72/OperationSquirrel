    <p>Open-source robotics built for schools, students, and aspiring engineers.</p>

    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Operation Squirrel was created to give students access to the same tools,
        algorithms, and engineering workflows used in the robotics industry. 
        Everything is open-source, modifiable, and designed to support real-world learning.

    <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
    <p>
        Most educational robotics kits hide the real engineering behind closed systems.
        Operation Squirrel is different — every part of the stack is exposed, from AI detection
        to flight control to onboard Linux systems. Students learn real autonomy,
        not toy-level coding.
