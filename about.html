        <h2>The Founders</h2>
        <p>
            The Operation Squirrel development kit was created by <strong>Shaun Bowman</strong> and <strong>Cameron Rose</strong>, 
            two software engineers who met while working together on General Motors’ Super Cruise (Level&nbsp;2 autonomous) driving program. 
            The drone autonomy stack that evolved into Operation Squirrel began as a side project—an effort to build an advanced, 
            high-performance autonomous drone using affordable, off-the-shelf components without compromising engineering quality.

                <h3>Shaun — Senior AI/ML Software Engineer (Torc Robotics)</h3>
                <p>
                    Shaun is currently a Senior AI/ML Software Engineer at Torc Robotics, where he develops core 
                    communication and software infrastructure for commercial self-driving semi-trucks. His work 
                    supports real-time autonomy running across clusters of Jetson AGX Orin embedded computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before joining Torc, Shaun worked as a Senior AI Engineer at General Motors, contributing to 
                    several core components of the Super Cruise Level&nbsp;2 autonomous driving system. His work 
                    included developing mapping systems and lateral control planning (such as automatic lane changes), 
                    with software deployed across hundreds of thousands of production vehicles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earlier in his career, Shaun supported hybrid vehicle calibration and testing within GM’s advanced 
                    propulsion programs. These roles gave him extensive experience building real-time autonomous systems 
                    that meet rigorous automotive safety and reliability standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is also an inventor on multiple patents related to autonomous vehicle algorithms and system 
                    design. Outside of industry projects, Shaun has built real autonomous platforms—including a 
                    Jetson-powered self-driving RC car capable of operating autonomously at 60 mph—demonstrating his 
                    practical experience in high-performance embedded autonomy.

                <h3>Cameron — Embedded Systems & Vehicle Software Engineer</h3>
                <p>
                    Cameron is an Embedded Software Engineer developing propulsion control and hybrid 
                    mode-selection algorithms for modern automotive platforms. His work centers on predictive 
                    control—software that anticipates future vehicle states and selects optimal operating 
                    conditions in real time—while meeting the strict reliability and deterministic timing 
                    requirements of safety-critical automotive systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to his hybrid vehicle propulsion work, Cameron developed charge-time estimation algorithms 
                    for EVs including the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Escalade IQ, and Celestiq, and is an inventor 
                    on several related patents. His software is deployed across hundreds of thousands of production 
                    vehicles in daily use, where accuracy and dependability are essential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering and is currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer 
                    Science (Machine Learning) to deepen his background in autonomy, perception, and GPU-accelerated 
                    robotics. Cameron’s engineering experience spans firmware development, control algorithms, 
                    system integration, and hardware–software interfacing across complex vehicle architectures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of industry, Cameron co-developed the Operation Squirrel autonomy stack, integrating 
                    real-time perception, control, and embedded systems into a fully functioning autonomous drone 
                    platform. His work bridges low-level engineering with applied machine learning and robotics.

        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
            We built Operation Squirrel as a learning tool for ourselves. It worked—so well that it led to high-value
            engineering job opportunities for us. We're confident it can do the same for you.
        </p>   
        
        <p>
            Operation Squirrel began as an attempt to build a drone capable of <strong>dynamic payload delivery</strong> using
            affordable hardware. As we worked, we kept noticing a bigger issue: students rarely get access to 
            <strong>real engineering systems</strong>. The critical pieces—control loops, perception, timing, and real-world
            failure modes—are usually hidden behind simplified kits.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So we built a platform to change that—open, practical, and built on the same tools and constraints used in
            professional robotics. Dynamic payload delivery is only the beginning. We get you to the fun part instantly,
            while giving you fully open, adaptable software for whatever you want to build next.
