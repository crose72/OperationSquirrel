<section>
    <h2>What Is It?</h2>
    <p>
        A complete, ready-to-fly, open-source autonomous drone kit designed for real-world AI, robotics,
        and engineering education. Unlike closed commercial systems, every component, algorithm, and toolchain
        is accessible, modifiable, and fully documented — giving students industry-grade experience with the
        technologies used in modern robotics companies.
    </p>
